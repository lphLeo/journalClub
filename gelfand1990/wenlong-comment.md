It is a very nice presentation on introducing substitution, Gibbs, and Importance Sampling, the presenter explain the mathematical details and motivations very well. A few suggestions are:

1. It would be nice to introduce some practical motivation of the algorithms, perhaps a concrete example where it is necessary to estimate marginal distribution in a sampling fashion. 
2. Similar to 1, it is helpful to explain some occasions that only full conditional distribution is available when moving on to Gibbs sampling.
3. Showing some demonstration of the algorithm behaviour in a 2-dimensional toy example may help students understand better on the intuition of the algorithm.
4. Overall I suggest including less equations and mathematical results (for example, the convergence result) in the slides, and give more high level explanation.
