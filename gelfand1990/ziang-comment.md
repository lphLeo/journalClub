Feedback for Sophia and Amber on Gelfand90

- The results for substitution sampling, gibbs sampling, and importance sampling are presented very clearly.

-  I like the last part about more recent progress in sampling algorithms, as it provides students with additional background if they are interested in this area.

-  One suggestion I have is to give some intuition on substitution sampling.
  In your slides, you present a iterative formula for marginal distribution followed by substitution sampling. 
 It's not that clear to me why iterative formula leads to substituion sampling. Perhaps offering alternative intuition for understanding substitution sampling would be beneficial.

-  Before introducing substitution sampling, providing an example where we only have access to two conditional distributions would be helpful.
